		<h1>Wecome to the Internet!</h1>

		<p>This is the home of AS{{AS}} served to you by {{IP}}. If you can read this from another AS, the Internet is working - thanks for your peering and routing effort to make this joint effort work. Welcome to our cyberspace.</p>

		<p>If you want to enjoy a piece of history, visit the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">very first web page on the Internet</a> by Sir Berners-Lee at CERN. The World Wide Web looked very similar to this page back then. If you want to how see how information was shared before the WWW, research about <i>Gopher</i> (e.g., <a href="https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/">floodgap HTTP gateway</a> - the Gopherspace is still alive and a prallel world to the WWW!) or <i>FTP</i>. Have fun.</p>
